Hi, I am a master's student at the University of Zurich, majoring in Data Science and Informatics.

With over two years of hands-on experience in data analysis, my skills include Python, Java, SQL, Software Engineering, Machine Learning, Data Visualization and Project Management. Additionally, I am a fast learner, enjoy tackling challenges, and trying new things.

My enthusiasm lies in effectively managing and utilizing extensive datasets to enhance decision-making processes, with a particular interest in interpretable machine learning and explainable AI.
