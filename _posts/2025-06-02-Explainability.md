This project explores interpretable and explainable machine learning techniques applied to both tabular and image-based data.

We implemented and evaluated several models including Logistic Regression with Lasso regularization, Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), Neural Additive Models (NAMs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Also investigated and compared a range of explainability methods, including SHAP, Integrated Gradients, and Grad-CAM, aiming to provide insight into model decisions.  Results were compared across models and explanation techniques.

Below, you'll find some results visualizations from our reports.
