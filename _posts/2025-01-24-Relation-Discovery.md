This interactive visualization tool was developed as part of our Masterâ€™s project to help non-expert users explore relationships between attributes in tabular data through interactive binning techniques.

Based on an extensive literature review of visualization methods and relation discovery algorithms, we iteratively refined the design before delivering a tool that allows users to upload CSV files and explore data via intuitive, step-by-step visualizations. The interface guides users through their datasets in an accessible and flexible way.

The application stack includes **React** for the frontend, **Python** and **FastAPI** for the backend, and **D3.js** for dynamic visual rendering.
