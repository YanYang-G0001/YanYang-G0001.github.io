This interactive visualization tool was designed and developed as part of our Master's project. Its goal is to help non-expert users explore relationships between attributes in tabular data using interactive binning.

Through a comprehensive literature review of visualization techniques and algorithms for relation discovery, we iterated through several design versions before building a tool that allows users to upload their own CSV data and explore it through flexible, intuitive visualizations.
The tool features an easy-to-navigate interface that guides users through a step-by-step exploration of their datasets. 

The tool is built using React, Python, FastAPI, and D3.js.

Below, you'll find our User & Task Characterization[1] and Design Evolution for further details.
