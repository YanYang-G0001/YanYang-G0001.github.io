This post summarizes several assignments I completed as part of my coursework in machine learning and deep learning. These assignments mainly consist of Jupyter notebooks focused on practical implementations and comparative analyses of various algorithms.

### Key Assignments

- **Comparison of NaÃ¯ve Bayes Classifier and Logistic Regression**
  Implemented NaÃ¯ve Bayes Classifier (NBC) from scratch and compared its performance with logistic regression across multiple datasets.

- **Open Set Recognition with Neural Networks**
  Trained a network capable of classifying known classes while effectively rejecting unknown samples.

- **Convolutional Network Training on FashionMNIST**
  Built and trained convolutional neural networks for image classification tasks on the FashionMNIST dataset.

- **Transfer Learning with Pre-trained Networks**
  Applied transfer learning techniques using pre-trained models based on ImageNet to new classification tasks.

- **Convolutional Auto-encoder Implementation**
  Designed and trained convolutional auto-encoders for unsupervised feature learning and data reconstruction.
